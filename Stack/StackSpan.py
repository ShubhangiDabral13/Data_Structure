# Problem:
# The stock span problem is a financial problem where we have a series of
# n daily price quotes for a stock and we need to calculate span of stock’s
# price for all n days.
# The span Si of the stock’s price on a given day i is defined as the maximum
# number of consecutive days just before the given day, for which the price
# of the stock on the current day is less than or equal to its price on the
# given day.
